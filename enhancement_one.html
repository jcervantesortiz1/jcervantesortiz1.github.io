        The <strong>Inventory Management App</strong> is a mobile application that allows users 
        to create an invenotry of their choosing, and perform various functions such as adding and removing
        items, as well as updating them. The application also sends users push notifications when an items
        inventory quantity is low.
        Developed originally in CS-360: Mobile Architect & Programming, the app underwent 
        significant upgrades in <strong>Enhancement One</strong> as part of my 
        <strong>CS-499: Computer Science Capstone</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These enhancements focused on implementing industry-standard solutions, improving 
        user interactivity, and ensuring secure, reliable data handling. The applications improvements
        include creating a way to allow users to stay signed in as well as log out, create a post notficiations
        system, and lastly add proper input validation to the system.

    <h2>Key Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Input Validation:</strong> Ensured that there are default values for the name, sku, and amount
            to prevent the application from crashing. Also made it so the system checks that the value passed in
            is valid before it runs the database command(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved SMS Notification system:</strong> Fixed SMS notification system to only send the user
            a text when an item is deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Created Post Notification system:</strong> Added a notifcation system that sends the user
            an app notification when an item is low in stock.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Login and Logout Functions:</strong> Added shared preferences to ensure user stays signed in 
            even if they close the application and re-open it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The following changes were implemented to enhance the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Created the <code>InputVlaidation</code> class to validate inputs. Furthermore set the default values of
            name= "No Name", sku="N/A", and amount "1" if the values passed in are not valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Integrated the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission to allow the system to send app notifcations,
            while also ensuring that the SMS notifications were still active. This allows the app to send
            an app notification when something is low in stock, and a text message when an item is deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enhanced the Login/Sign Up process to keep users signed in through the use of shared preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implemented detailed user feedback mechanisms, including error messages and 
            success notifications, to enhance usability.
        </li>
    </ul>
