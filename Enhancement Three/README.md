# Animal Database and Dashboard

## Overview
The **Animal Database and Dashboard** is a involves a python script that creates, reads, updates, and deletes information from the Animal MongoDB database. It also has a dashboard that retrieves data from the database and displays it on a datatable along with a pie chart of the animals by breed, and a map with the location of the first animal. It also includes a README file for the stakeholders so they may reproduce the system or install it. The enhancements align with industry best practices for scalable and efficient database solutions while improving the system's usability, scalability, and maintainability.

This repository documents the enhancements made to the system as part of **Category Three Enhancement** for the **CS-499: Computer Science Capstone**. This enhancement aligns with the following course outcomes.

1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.  
2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  
4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

## Features

### **Original Project Features**

1. **MongoDB Database**
    - The animal database was created using the command prompt, and was managed using the command line.
2. **Python Driver Class**
    - Drier class that is used to connect to the animal database, and has the create, read, update, and delete functions.
3. **DASH Dashboard**
    - The dashboard is created using DASH. It consists of a interactable datatable, a pie chart, and a map with the location of the first animal in the data table.

### **Enhancment(s)**
1. **Re-create the MongoDB Database**
    - Created the animal database by using MongoDB Compass, which allowed for easier management of the database.
2. **Testing and Error Handling**
    - A testing class was created to ensure proper functionality of the system, as well as added error handling to the driver class to ensure the system would notify users of any issues.
3. **Dashboard Visual Improvements**
    - Updated the dashboards layout to have a better design, while also adding filter options to the data table.

## Screenshots

## Conclusion
The Grazios Salvare Dashboard is now able to be accessed on a Windows device. Through the use of the new testing class we can ensure that the database connections are done properly. The systems README documentation is also updated to ensure users are able to install it on their local system. Furthermore since the dashboard only has access to retrieve data from the database, there are no security threats.
