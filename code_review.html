    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This code review focuses on three key projects from my portfolio:
        <strong>Inventory Tracking Application, Grazioso Salvare Dashboard, Animal Database and Dashboard</strong>.
        These artifacts align with three critical categories of computer science:
        <strong>Software Engineering and Design</strong>, <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>, 
        and <strong>Databases</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this review, I analyze the current functionality of these projects, identify key areas for improvement, 
        and outline planned enhancements. This is an informal code review so the review focusses on the directly actionable
        items I was looking to address, while skipping over the various stylistic and syntaxtical errors, since those 
        are issues that would be addressed regardless of the project.
        The various updates and enhancements made to the systems highlight my proficiency in identifying areas of concern
        within large projects, while still designing robust, scalable, secure, and user focussed software solutions.

  <h2>Enhancement Highlights</h2>

  <h3>Inventory Management Application</h3>
  <h4>Enhancement 1: Software Engineering and Design</h4>
  <p>
    This project is an inventory management application that allows the user to sign in and manage their inventory. The 
    application currently consists of two separate SQLite databases that hold login information and user inventory. The 
    user can view, add, update, and delete items from their inventory. All information is saved locally on to the device 
    and runs on android 14 and newer. The application also has a notification system that will send the user a text message 
    if an items inventory is low or gets deleted.
  </p>

  <h3>Grazioso Salvare Pet Management System</h3>
  <h4>Enhancement 2: Algortihms and Data Structures</h4>
  <p>
    This project is an animal management system that allows the user to track various things about the dogs and monkeys they have. 
    Users also have the ability to reserve animals directly from the system.
  </p>

  <h3>Animal Database and Dashboard</h3>
  <h4>Enhancement 3: Databases</h4>
  <p>
    The project first involves creating a python script to create, read, update, and delete information from the MongoDB. Then a 
    dashboard is created to read data from the database. The system is created on the Ubuntu device, and consists of a MongoDB 
    database, a python driver class, and a DASH dashboard. It also includes a README file for the stakeholders so they may reproduce 
    the system or install it.
