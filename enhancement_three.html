        The <strong>Animal Database and Dashboard</strong> is a Mongo database, with a user dashboard. It consists of
        the Mongo database, a Python driver class, and a DASH dashboard. Furthermore the project has a README file that
        walks users and stakeholders on how to install the system to their Linux system.
        Developed originally in CS-340: Client/Server Development, the system underwent 
        significant upgrades in <strong>Enhancement Three</strong> as part of my 
        <strong>CS-499: Computer Science Capstone</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These enhancements focused on implementing industry-standard solutions, improving 
        user interactivity, and ensuring secure, reliable data handling in the Windows system. The overall
        enhancement allows the user to install and run the system on a Windows system instead of Linux. Furthermore
        a testing class is created to ensure proper functionality and connection to the database. Lastly the 
        updated README provides insight on how to install and run the system while also showing and explaining to the
        user the various features of the dashboard.

    <h2>Key Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>New MongoDB Database:</strong> The database needed to be created on Windows. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Proper Testing:</strong> A testing class was created to allow users to ensure that the system 
            is able to connect to the database and perform various functions as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Created a DASH Dashboard:</strong> Created a DASH dashboard so that the user is able to see all 
            of the animals in the database on a data table, offer filtering options, as well as display important information 
            such as the breed breakdown and location in easy to view charts and maps.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The following changes were implemented to enhance the system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Created the database to hold the animal data. This was done using MongoDB compass. For how it was done step 
            by step you can consult the README file.
        </li>
        <li>
            The testing class ensures that the main driver class functions properly. It tests that the driver class can properly 
            connect to the user database. After that the system tests that it can create different type of animals and add them to the 
            database, and that the proper exception is thrown when the user tries to create an invalid item. Then it ensures it is able to 
            retrieve infromation from the database and ensure that it throws the right execption when it tries to process an invalid querie. 
            It tests that the system can properl yupdate differeent items, and throw the correct exception when it is uanable too for any given reason. 
            Lastly it checks that entries can be deleted and that an exception is thrown when it is not able to do so for any reason. This testing class is 
            very important in ensuring that the database and its connections work properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            The user dashboard was created using DASH which is a low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python. The dashboard will connect to the
            database and display the database information in a data table that user is able to filter through. The system also has 3 filters for different types of
            search and rescue options, and a reset option. Below the datatable there is a Pie chart of the animals in the database broken down by 
            their breed, and next to it is a map that shows the location of the selected animal or the first animal in the datatable. When the user 
            uses one of the filter options (whether one of the built in ones, or they filter through the data table) the pie chart and map will both update
            accordingly to reflect the changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other small improvements to the system include adding proper error handling to the create, read, update, and 
            delete methods.
        </li>
    </ul>
