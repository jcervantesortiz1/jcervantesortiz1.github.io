    <p>
        The <strong>Grazioso Salvare Pet Management System</strong> is a Java based system that gives the user
        the ability to see and manage dogs and monkeys from the Grazioso Salvare system. The user is able to add
        a dog or moneky to the system, view a list of the animals, and lastly reserve an animal. The system is a 
        console application.
        Developed originally in IT-145: Foundation in Application Development, the system underwent 
        significant upgrades in <strong>Enhancement Two</strong> as part of my 
        <strong>CS-499: Computer Science Capstone</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These enhancements focused on implementing industry-standard solutions, improving 
        user interactivity, and ensuring secure, reliable data handling. The system improvemnts look at creating
        a proper class structure for the system, added secure coding practices to ensure proper system function, 
        and convert the current Arraylist storage mechanisms so that they use a Hashmap instead.

    <h2>Key Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>New Class Structure:</strong> Moved functions to a new Logic.java class that will handle all of
            the system logic, and only leaving the main method and the menu method in the Driver.java class.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Added try and catch blocks to ensure that improper input doesn't cause
            the system to crash.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Created a Remove Animal Method:</strong> Added a way that users can remove an animal from the
            system if they need to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Data Storage:</strong> Converted the system to use a Hashmap instead of an Arraylist.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The following changes were implemented to enhance the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Created the <code>Logic</code> class to hold all of the system logic, and leaving only the main method
            and menu method in the Driver.java class, which allows for system upgrades and feature add ons later. The 
            new Logic.java class also has a Remove animal method that removes an animal from the Hashmap.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added try and catch blocks in any method that requires user input. This ensures that if the user passes in an
            invalid variable or empty line that the system terminates the process and tells them the input is invalid.
        </li>
        <li>
            The remove method will ask the user for the type of animal they want to remove, and what their name is. The system
            then will go through the objects key, value pairs and remove the animal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Migrated teh system to use a HashMap instead of an ArrayList. The HashMap allows for items to be found easier. If 
            the system only has a few animals then there is no recognizable speed differences between using an ArrayList vs a 
            HashMap, but when looking at a system that perhaps has hundreds of animals, having to iterate through every single item
            can take up processing power and much more time. 
        </li>
    </ul>
